            <p class="">Located in Central Myanmar, only 4 hours away from Mandalay, Bagan is one of the world’s greatest archaeological sites. Visit this amazing historical town hosting more than 2,200 temples big and small. Set amongst thick greenery on the Ayeyarwady
                river basin with misty mountains at a distance, Bagan will surely enchant you with its mystical appearance. The temples rise above the canopy of trees, presenting a picture-perfect scenery to visitors.</p>
            <p class="mt-4">
                Bagan was the first capital of the Pagan Kingdom between the 9th to 13th centuries. More than 10,000 Buddhist temples, pagodas and monasteries were constructed during the most flourishing days of the Kingdom between the 11th to 13th centuries. Today,
                around 2,200 temples and pagodas still survive and are carefully looked after by the government.

        destination, Bagan has innumerable licensed tourist transport services to help tourists enjoy this beautiful site.

                Apart from the temples, visitors can also enjoy a leisure trip on the Ayeyarwady River, Myanmar’s lifeline. Take a cruise from Mandalay to Bagan and enjoy the riparian vegetation, the soothing river breeze and not to mention the sights and sounds of life
                along the river. You will also be able to indulge in the fascinating views of Mt. Sagaing, Pakokku, Myingyan and other sites along the way.

        <p class="mt-6 text-white">History tells us that Bagan was founded in the 2nd Century AD and fortified in 849AD by King Pyinbya, a successor of the founder of Bagan. The city was the capital of the Pagan Empire from 1044 to 1287. During this time, the rulers and wealthy
            subjects constructed more than 10,000 religious monuments. The city prospered during this time and grew in size. It was centre for secular and religious studies. The Pagan empire collapsed in 1287.

            <p>Bagan is one of the most famous archaeological sites in the world. Explore the ancient monuments of different periods spread all across the city. These monuments stretch over a vast area on the bank of Ayeyarwady river up to the Turintaung
                range. Although the best way to explore these temples is by foot, a unique idea to enjoy a panoramic view of the Bagan temples is by taking a ride on a hot air balloon. Taking this ride during sunrise and sunset is the icing on the cake
                and we highly recommend that. Those who are not keen to take a balloon ride need not get disappointed. You can simply climb up to the top terrace of the Bagan viewing tower and enjoy the wide expanse of temples.</p>
            <p class="mt-4">
                The town is not only about temples. You should also take a cruise down the Ayeyarwady river and enjoy the scenic sunset. The river, the heartline of Myanmar has breathtaking views which should not be missed. You can also take a boat ride between Mandalay
                and Bagan and enjoy the view.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4">
                For the shopaholic, a visit to Bagan is incomplete without visiting the famous Bagan Lacquerware handicraft market and picking up some mementoes. You can also visit factories and get a first-hand experience of oil processing and palm sugar (jaggery) production.
